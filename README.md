# Employee Management System with CRUD Operations, Password Reset, and Hashed Login

This repository contains an Employee Management System with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, password reset functionality, and secure hashed login. The system is designed to efficiently manage employee records and provide essential features for administrators.

## Features

1. **Employee CRUD Operations**: The system allows administrators to perform CRUD operations on employee records, including creating new employees, retrieving employee information, updating employee details, and deleting employees from the system.

2. **Password Reset**: Administrators can reset an employee's password in case they forget it or need to update it. The password reset process follows a secure workflow to ensure the privacy and security of the employee's account.

3. **Hashed Login**: The login functionality is implemented using secure hashing techniques to protect user credentials. Passwords are securely hashed before storage, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized individuals to access sensitive information.
